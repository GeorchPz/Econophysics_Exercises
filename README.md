- **3_ARCH_&_GARCH_processes.ipynb**: Implementation of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models for volatility forecasting.
- **4_Correlations.ipynb**: Analysis of various financial correlations, including correlation matrices, asset graphs, and hierarchical clustering techniques.
- **5_Portfolio_Optimization.ipynb**: Modern Portfolio Theory implementation with efficient frontier calculation and portfolio performance evaluation.
- **6_Options.ipynb**: Option pricing models and derivatives analysis.
- **MPT_cryptocurrencies_and_traditional_assets.ipynb**: Comparative analysis of Modern Portfolio Theory applied to cryptocurrency and traditional asset markets.
